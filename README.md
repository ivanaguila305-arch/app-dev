# Stranger Things  

**Stranger Things** is my favorite *Netflix* series. It’s a mix of **sci-fi**, **horror**, and **friendship** set in the 1980s. The story begins when **Will Byers** goes missing, leading his friends to uncover a creepy world called the **Upside Down**.  

> “Friends don’t lie.” – *Eleven*

2. **Mike** – Her loyal friend  
3. **Dustin** – Smart and funny  
4. **Lucas** – Brave and realistic
